Order of Operations (OOps)

On each tick (time step) we need to generate new magnetic and electric fields.

1. Move the electric and magnetic fields stored in the current variables to the
    locations for the fields from the previous time steps

2. Generation of the electric field
    - Use Coulumb's Law to find the electric field based on the locations of point charges
    - Use Ampere's Law to find the time derivative of the electric field from the curl
        of the magnetic field in the previous time step and integrate
    - Save as the current electric field

3. Generation of the magnetic field
    - Initial magnetic field is 0
    - Use Faraday's Law to find the time derivative of the magnetic field from the curl
        of the electric field in the previous time step and integrate
    - Use a Helmholtz Decomposition to ensure a divergence-free vector field
    - Save as the current magnetic field

Because we are using the curl of the previous electric and magnetic fields when generating
the next iteration, we need to somehow store the previous iteration's fields, so that
we have two electric fields and two magnetic fields (one of each for the current time step
and another of each from the previous time step)

So we have all four stored outside the time loop and then be updated as we advance in time
